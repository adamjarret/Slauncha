
Slauncha
======================


Slauncha is a Windows application that displays an on-screen menu for quickly launching Steam games using the [Xbox 360 Wireless Controller for Windows](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000KA5T6A?ie=UTF8&tag=adamjarretcom-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B000KA5T6A). It is currently in beta.


System Requirements
----------------------

Slauncha has currently only been tested on Windows 7. It should work fine on both 32-bit and 64-bit editions, but I'm not sure about Vista and earlier.



Installing Slauncha
----------------------

Download the zip file, extract it and move the entire folder into C:\Program Files (or wherever you like).



Using Slauncha
----------------------

Games can be added to the menu by right clicking on the tray icon and choosing Configure. Click the [+] button in the Configure window to browse for a shortct to add. At this time only Steam shortcuts with the extension **.url** are supported.

To create a shortcut to a Steam game, right click on the game in Steam and choose *Create Desktop Shortcut*. The shortcut will appear on your desktop.

Once a shortcut has been added to Slauncha, you may remove from your Desktop.


Navigating the Menu
----------------------

Show the menu by hitting the **Start** button, hide it with the **Back** button. Use the **left thumb stick** or the **D-pad** to move through menu items and launch a game by pressing the **A** button.

You can also show the menu by clicking on the tray icon and use the keyboard arrow keys to navigate and Enter to launch games.


Roadmap
----------------------

Slauncha is currently in beta and is still missing a few key features:

* The ability to display more menu items than can fit in the window. Scrolling/pagination is not currently supported.

* Full screen mode

* Support for Non-Steam shortcuts

* Re-name menu items


Compiling From Source
----------------------

Compiling the source code requires [Visual C# 2008 Express Edition](http://www.microsoft.com/express/Downloads/#Visual_Studio_2008_Express_Downloads) and [Microsoft XNA Game Studio 3.0](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=7d70d6ed-1edd-4852-9883-9a33c0ad8fee&displaylang=en) (both free). At the time of this writing Visual Studio 2010 does not support XNA Game Studio.
